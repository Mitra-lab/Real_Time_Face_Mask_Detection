# Real-Time Face Mask Detection System
## Overview

This project involves the development of a real-time face mask detection system using advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms. The system is capable of identifying individuals without masks and triggers an alarm system in real-time to alert them.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: The system uses a camera feed to detect the presence of face masks in real-time.
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning**: Implemented using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
- **Alarm System**: Integrated an alarm system to alert individuals not wearing masks.
- **Testing & Optimization**: Conducted extensive testing and optimization to ensure high accuracy and efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV: For real-time computer vision capabilities.
  - TensorFlow: For deep learning model implementation.
